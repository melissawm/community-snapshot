# community-snapshot
Tools for gathering metrics around open-source communities.

This repo constains a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/) which takes information from a GitHub repository and creates summaries, plots and reports based on a few common metrics used to measure open source community health.

This project is heavily based on the [jupyter-activity-snapshot](https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-activity-snapshot).
